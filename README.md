## Step 0 : Setup

Welcome to Drupal 8!

In the _0-setup_ branch you will find a module called *sitesurvey* that contains a set of scaffolding files that introduce Drupal 8 module structure.

Also included are Simpletests for the functionality required by the module. You can read the module specification in the sitesurvey/README.md file.
